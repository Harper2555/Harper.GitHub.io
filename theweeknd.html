<h1><mark>Theweeknds music career</mark></h1>    
<p>Tesfaye began releasing music anonymously in 2009. After co-founding the record label XO, he released three mixtapes—House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence—in 2011, and gained recognition for his alternative R&B sound, as well as the mystery surrounding his identity. He signed with Republic Records to reissue the mixtapes into the compilation album Trilogy (2012), and release his debut studio album, Kiss Land (2013) the following year. After a string of collaborations and film soundtrack contributions from 2013 and 2014, Tesfaye began combining his signature alternative R&B sound with a more pop-oriented approach on his second and third studio albums, Beauty Behind the Madness (2015) and Starboy (2016); both debuted atop the US Billboard 200 while spawning the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "Can't Feel My Face", "The Hills", "Starboy", and "Die for You".

<p>He returned to a more alternative R&B-dominated soundscape for his debut extended play, My Dear Melancholy (2018), which included the US top-ten single "Call Out My Name". He started making an album trilogy named after three chronologic time points and explored the dream pop and new wave genres with the trilogy's first installment and fourth studio album, After Hours (2020), which spawned the chart-topping singles "Heartless" and "Save Your Tears", as well as "Blinding Lights", which became the best-performing song in the Billboard Hot 100's history and the longest-charting song at the time. Tesfaye began exploring dance-pop, leading to the second installment and fifth album, Dawn FM (2022), which included the US top-ten single, "Take My Breath". In 2023, he co-created and starred in the HBO drama series The Idol, which drew significant controversy and was received as a critical failure. His sixth album and third and final installment of the trilogy, Hurry Up Tomorrow (2025), yielded the US top-five single "Timeless" and a critically panned companion film of the same name.
